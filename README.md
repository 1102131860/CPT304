# CPT304 Library Management System with different Pattern Design

This a library project that implements several pattern designs to achieve fast prototyping and steady operation.

There are 6 patterns in this project:

**1. Single Pattern**: there will be only one library instance that accesses to the database

**2. Factory Pattern**: create different types of books with given data

**3. Decorator Pattern**: dynamically add function and behavior to a specific book

**4. Observer Pattern**: add new subscriber into book subscribing list and add message into queue

**5. Strategy Pattern**: deals the change in the book searching with adverse searching tags

**6. State Pattern**: smoothly switched book states between available and absent states

This project foucses on the pattern design instead of project implementation.
